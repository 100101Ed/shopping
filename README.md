# Shopping at msn, eBay, Amazon
* Create 9 test cases. 
* All of these test case scenarios should have 3 sets of data, each using a data driven approach. 
* Amazon (ME):
  * User adds a certain quantity of an item to their cart.  Validate that the user has added that number of items to their cart. 
  * User adds three items to their cart.  Validate that the total cost comes out to what they would expect to have in their shopping cart.
  * User deleted a number of items of their cart if there are items.  Validate that the items were deleted.
* Ebay (Denies):
  * User watches a particular item. Validate that the item is in the user's account as that item being watched.
  * Navigate through the dropdown menu from the top of the Screen to a particular item (ex Power Sports). Select one of the images on the home page of those items. Add the first item on the list. Validate that this item is added to your cart.
  * ?(Create your own test case)
* MSN:
  * User select the first item on the Editors' Pick. User than clicks on the comments at the botom. Validate that the number of comments is only between 10-50 comments.
  * User selects at topic from the menu at the top. Validate that their are at least 6 items under a specific topic within that category.
  * ?(Create your own test case)

### Additional Notes:

* Allow tests to support a Data Driven Approach by providing separate data providers to for each test case scenario. 
* You may hard-coding data - although it would be preferred if you got the data from an external source (text file, excel file, database).
* Try to support at least 3 browsers.
* Use a base framework to speed up time in getting started, use of helper methods is encouraged.
* Take screenshots during the execution of your code and store these screen shots in a folder under your projects working directory.
* Commit on a file-by-file basis at minimum.
